The form looks pretty ugly and tiny, doesn't it? Shall we make it more pretty and accessible?

Assignment #1: Give a color to the `<label>`.

Assignment #2: Make the size of the input text bigger.

Assignment #3: Make the submit `<button>` bigger and make the cursor look like a hand pointer when you hover on it; select the button in a way that if the form had more than one button, only the submit button would be affected
