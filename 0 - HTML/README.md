# HTML Exercises

With the help of the [HTML learning resources of w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp), Google and your mentor, let's do the following assignments.

Note: you don't have to complete all the assignments.

Assignment #0:
Create a comment somewhere inside the `<body>` tag.

Assignment #1:
Add this image `https://bit.ly/futupink-yes` somewhere inside the `<body>` tag.

Assignment #2:
Create a link `<a>` to your favorite website.

### Extra exercises

Assignment #3:
Create a list for the following ingredients: `flour`, `eggs`, `milk`.

Assignment #4:
Create a form with an `<input>` (remember to add a `<label>`) and a submit `<button>`. Bonus points (we're not really keeping points) if you add a `aria-describedby` property to the `<input>`.
You can check the `index.html` page of the folder `1 - CSS` if you need some guidance, but try first to solve this with Google and/or your mentor.
